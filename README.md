# Region-Finder

## Usage

To use this you install the packages from requirements.txt,
then you run the program, then you move your
mouse to the upper left corner of where you want to get the pos
of, then press shift(or whatever you set the keybind to), then
move to the top left of where you want the pos of, then press
shift again, then the console will print out a nice list of
[x1, y1, x2, y2]
it will also take a test screenshot and save it to test.png for you
to look at.
